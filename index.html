            <h1>Hey Come Hang Out: 2024 Edition</h1>
            
            <p>Your friends Kyle and/or Kat are having yet another casual joint birthday hangout, and if you're reading this you should join us!</p>

            <section>
                <h2>What?</h2>
                <p>Come to a bar with us! Have a beer, a snack, or just come hang out! 
                    We have a ton of friends in common and a general desire to overcome to ambient bleakness of our shared birth month. 
                    This is the THIRD iteration of this party and it was fun the last two times 
                    so we're gonna do it again.</p>

                <p><strong>... wait, isn't there a pandemic on?</strong> 
                    Yeah, but we're both vaccinated and boostered, and we presume you are by now too.<br/><br/> 
                    We tried having this in an outdoor bar last year but ended up freezing, so we made this choice to do this inside,
                    even though it's winter and illness rates are high. You're obviously welcome to wear a mask if you choose, and
                    <em>please stay the fuck home if you're at all feeling ill.</em> 
                    We 100% understand if this is not in your risk profile right now, and if so, 
                    we look forward to seeing you in a different time and/or environment soon. ❤️
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>When?</h2> 
                <p>
                    <strong>Wednesday, February 7th, 2024.</strong>
                    We'll be there from 6:30pm onwards; you're welcome to swing by at any point, and stay for as little or as long as you wish.
                </p>
                <p><strong>... wait, isn't that a school night?</strong> Yeah, but, like, Kyle's turning 40 and has work the next day. We're not going to be out super late. Anyway, this is basically the only time this whole month that works with both of our schedules. Hooray for non-monogamy!</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Where?</h2> 
                <p>
                    <a href="https://asyouaredc.com/" target="_blank">as you are</a>, our favorite queer bar in DC. There's your usual local beer and cider and cocktails, a full suite of non-alcoholic drinks, and good food with vegan options.
                    
                    It's a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Eastern+Market,+701+Pennsylvania+Ave.+SE,+Washington,+DC+20003/as+you+are.+DC,+8th+Street+Southeast,+Washington,+DC/@38.8834193,-76.9978483,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b833ac66506b:0x3b60521b76e78b6a!2m2!1d-76.995842!2d38.88427!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b937d014cfc9:0x46eb3f6da09a3f01!2m2!1d-76.9947749!2d38.8825764!3e2?entry=ttu" target="_blank">three minute walk</a>
                    from the Eastern Market metro station on the Blue/Orange/Silver lines. If you're driving, street parking is available as long as you don't mind searching a few blocks away.
                </p>

                <p><strong>... wait, but what if I'm straight?</strong> You're still welcome -- in our experience, AYA's vibe is far more "cafe that a lot of queer people hang out in" rather than "gay bar."</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Who?</h2> 
                <p>
                    You, your partners, and your good friends are all invited. No need to bother with RSVPs, apologies, or gifts.
                </p>

                <p><strong>... wait, is Kate coming?</strong> It's still not like she has a choice.</p>
